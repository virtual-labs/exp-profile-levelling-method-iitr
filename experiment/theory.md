### Introduction
<br>
Profile levelling is a method of surveying that has been carried out along the central line of a track of land on which a linear engineering work is to be constructed/ laid. The operations involved in determining the elevation of ground surface at small spatial interval along a line is called profile leveling.<br><br>

### Principle 
<br>
Simple addition and subtraction is used to determine the elevations of various points.<br>
<br>

### Equipments Used 
<br>
1) Auto level with tripod.<br>
2) Graduated Staff.<br>
3) Measuring Tape.<br>
<br>

### Dos and Don'ts
<br>

#### Dos<br>
1) Center and level the base of plane table accurately.<br>
2) Crosshairs must be focused sharply.<br>
3) Keep the backsight and foresight distances nearly equal to compensate for collimation error, if any.<br>
4) Always take 3 or more observations of each point to take the average.<br>
5) Take sufficient number of observations at regular interval along and across the direction of survey, so as to represent the ground profile (longitudinal and cross-sectional) accurately.<br>
6) In profile levelling, use Height of Instrument Method for computation of RI's.<br>
7) Apply checks after computing RI's.<br>
8) Find closing error and distribute it.<br><br>

#### Don'ts<br>

1) Handle the Auto Level with utmost care. If dropped accidently, it may damage compensator and digital display.<br>
2) If using aluminum staff, be away from electric poles, transformers and wires.<br>
3) While shifting the instrument from one station to another station, always keep it in box for transport.<br>
4) Protect the instrument from heavy rains.<br><br>
