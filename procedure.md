### Steps to perform experiment<br>
Step-1) START Button: This button on click will navigate to the menu page consists of three buttons i.e. OBJECTIVE OF EXPERIMENT Button, EQUIPMENT DETAILS Button and OBSERVATIONS & PLOTTING Button.<br><br>
Step-2) QUIT Button: It is used to exit the page.<br><br>
Step-3) OBJECTIVE OF EXPERIMENT Button: This button provides objective of the experiment.<br><br>
Step-4) EQUIPMENT DETAILS Button: This button provides equipment details, used in the experiment.<br><br>
Step-5) OBSERVATION & PLOTTING Button: It contains two buttons ie.e. BROWSER & FLASH BASED SIMULATIONS Button.<br><br>
Step-6) Click on BROWSER BASED button, it will navigate to the simluation page where you need to click on EQUIPMENT SETUP Button.<br><br>
Step-7) After this, you need to setup autolevel instrument by placing it on the tripod.<br><br>
Step-8) After this, click on LEVEL SETUP Button & setup blue bubble dot to the center.After this, click on Next Button.<br><br>
Step-9) Click on the START Button, staff at point A & observation table will appear.<br><br>
Step-10) Click on the staff at point A & take a back sight, marked as the bench mark, after this points will automatically mark at regular intervals.<br><br>
Step-11)  Click on the NEXT Button. Take the observtaions at these regular intervals (points i.e.1,2,34) with the help of staff( click on each staff).<br><br>
Step-11) Repeat step 11 & take fore sight observation at TP 1 point. Click on the autolevel machine to move it at another location <br><br>
Step-12) Now take a back sight observation on TP1 & take observations at these regular intervals (points 5,6,7,8,9) with the help of staff & then click on the NEXT Button.<br><br>
Step-13) Now take a fore sight observation on final station C & also take the observtaions at salient point X.<br><br>
Step-14) Click on CALCULATE Button. & calculate obseravtions with the help of three buttons i.e. CALCULATE H.I.,CALCULATE R.I. & CALCULATE: DIFFERENCE IN ELEVATION.<br><br>
Step-15) Click on the FINISH Button to finish simulation.<br><br>
